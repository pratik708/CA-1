# CA-1Contribution from Account B

## Task E: Reflection

### Steps I Followed:
1. Created a public repo using Account A with a README.
2. Cloned and pushed local files from Account A.
3. Forked the repo using Account B.
4. Created a new branch `feature-update` in the fork.
5. Made changes and opened a pull request.
6. Logged back into Account A and merged the pull request.

### Challenges Faced:
- Faced a "permission denied" error when trying to push from Account B. Realized I was trying to push to Account Aâ€™s repo instead of my fork.
- Fixed it by forking the repo correctly and pushing to the fork.

### What I Learned:
- How collaboration works via forks, branches, and pull requests.
- Importance of permissions and understanding repository ownership.
